The Zip folder consists of the project along with the DB file, CSV file of the db,
Motion.arff and Database code.

The Assignment3_v2.db file is the Database file which we generated.
Motion.csv file is the csv conversion of the same, it is easier to observe the data.
Motion.arff file is the actual file which is used by the Weka SVM classifier to classify the data.
Database code is the separate code which we used to calculate the data.

Motion.arff is the only file which is required by the program and it is needed to be stored
in the directory: storage/sdcard of the emulator.
